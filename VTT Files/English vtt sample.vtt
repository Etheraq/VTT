<v Narrator>Running within a tunnel</v>

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.840
that's called the cochlea canal,

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.990
the structures that form the cochlea

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.363
are completely encased within the petrous temporal bone.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.750
Seen from above, the axis of the spiral is perpendicular

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.260
to the long axis of the petrous temporal bone

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.180
pointing almost horizontally.

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.720
However, it's common to describe the cochlea

9
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.823
as if it was upright with the apex at the top.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.660
In this dissection,

11
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.880
all the bone that surrounds the cochlea canal

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.060
has been removed except for a thin shell,

13
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.163
so we can see its overall shape.

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.293
The cochlea canal begins in the floor of the vestibule.

15
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.890
It first runs downwards and towards us

16
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.580
as seen in this antra lateral view,

17
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.490
then makes two and three quarters spiral turns

18
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.313
to end blindly here at the apex.

19
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.370
We'll be returning to this antra lateral view,

20
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.010
but for our first look inside the cochlea canal,

21
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.760
we'll go to a dry bone specimen that's been divided

22
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.820
in the horizontal plane,

23
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.150
and look down on it from above.

24
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.290
We'll flip our view so the apex of the cochlea

25
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.333
points upwards.

26
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.700
The cochlea canal spirals around

27
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.363
a hollow bony core, the modiolus.

28
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.470
Also spiraling around the modiolus

29
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.220
are two bony structures, the interscalar septum,

30
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.320
which separates at joining turns of the cochlea canal

31
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.430
and this projecting shelf, the spiral lamina,

32
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.383
which supports the basilar membrane.

33
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.680
At the apex, the cochlea canal ends

34
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.343
in a small dome, the cupola.

35
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.010
Beneath it, the two bony spirals end in interesting ways

36
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.963
as we'll see.

37
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.600
Along almost its whole length,

38
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.803
two membranes divide the cochlea into three compartments.

39
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.470
This is the all-important basilar membrane,

40
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.110
which houses the organ of hearing.

41
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.823
This slender membrane is Reissner's membrane.

42
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.823
Here are the same structures in a histologic cross-section.

43
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.930
Here's the basilar membrane,

44
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.280
here's Reissner's membrane.

45
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.010
The two membranes enclose the cochlear duct,

46
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.960
which contains endolymph

47
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.600
separating it from the scala vestibuli above

48
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.620
and the scala tympani below,

49
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.523
which both contain perilymph.

50
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.383
The cochlear duct is also known as the scala media.

51
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.960
The bony wall of the cochlear canal

52
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.510
is lined by a layer of periosteum.

53
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.750
In this preserved specimen,

54
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.910
we'll remove part of the bony wall

55
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.270
exposing the periosteum.

56
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.280
This is periosteum.

57
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.560
These black dots are melanocytes,

58
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.913
pigment cells whose function in the inner ear is uncertain.

59
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.070
We'll remove some of the periosteum

60
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.190
so we can look inside.

61
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.603
This is the cochlear duct.

62
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:09.270
Here's Reisner's membrane

63
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.193
moving a little as it's touched with a probe.

64
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.890
Removing part of Reisner's membrane,

65
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.290
we start to see the basilar membrane beneath it.

66
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.863
Here's the basilar membrane in full view.

67
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.160
To understand it better,

68
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.593
we'll go back to the histological image.

69
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.623
This is the basilar membrane.

70
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.380
Along its length, it's suspended

71
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.560
between these two structures,

72
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.060
the spiral lamina on the inside

73
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.633
and the spiral ligament on the outside.

74
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.100
The spiral lamina, which is formed partly of bone

75
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.993
projects from the modiolus.

76
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.480
The spiral ligament is a thickening of the periosteum.

77
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.360
The vital feature of the basilar membrane

78
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.950
is the organ of Corti that's just visible in a dissection.

79
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.253
It's this little bump.

80
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.680
This is the basilar membrane,

81
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.373
which moves in response to sound vibrations.

82
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.300
Over-hanging it, is the tectorial membrane,

83
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.593
which doesn't move.

84
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.900
Our sense of hearing depends on two sets of hair cells

85
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.503
in the organ of Corti.

86
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.820
This triple row of outer hair cells,

87
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.003
which actively amplify movements of the basilar membrane.

88
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.750
And this single row of inner hair cells,

89
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.823
which translate these movements into sensory nerve impulses.

90
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.253
Going back to the view we had before,

91
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.673
this is the spiral lamina,

92
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.700
here's the edge of the spiral ligament.

93
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.033
Here's the basilar membrane.

94
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.590
And these two thin lines indicate the inner

95
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.193
and outer hair cells.

96
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.740
Here, we can see almost the whole length

97
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.003
of the basilar membrane.

98
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.810
It starts in the floor of the vestibule

99
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.433
and ends just short of the apex.

100
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.220
Beneath the membrane here,

101
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.330
is the round window.

102
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.740
To see it, we'll remove this part of the basilar membrane

103
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.023
and spiral lamina.

104
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.160
This is the round window.

105
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.220
It's covered over by the round window membrane,

106
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.610
which faces medially into the round window recess

107
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.363
of the tympanic cavity.

108
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.520
The flexibility of the round window membrane

109
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.860
is what makes it possible for the stapes to move

110
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.593
and set up sound vibrations in the perilymph.

111
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.760
To see what happens at the apex of the cochlear,

112
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.690
where look from behind at a dry bone specimen

113
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.583
where we've exposed this much of the apical turn.

114
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.893
The specimen is transilluminated.

115
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.083
This is the apical turn.

116
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.803
This is part of the second turn.

117
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.540
This bony layer is the interscalar septum

118
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.860
that forms the floor of the cochlea canal.

119
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.250
It curls around beneath the cupola

120
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.110
twisting to end in a short free border,

121
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.620
which joins the underside of the cupola

122
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.253
to the tip of the modiolus.

123
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.650
This is the spiral lamina,

124
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.570
it curls around to end

125
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.670
as a free standing half crescent, the hamulus,

126
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.713
which supports the last part of the basilar membrane.

127
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.373
Here's the same area in a fresh specimen.

128
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.990
This is the end of the cochlear duct.

129
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.463
The hamulus is here.

130
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.600
Between the curved free border of the hamulus

131
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.360
and cochlear duct and the interscalar septum,

132
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.820
there's a circular opening, the helicotrema

133
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.580
where the scala vestibuli

134
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.343
and the Scala tympani become continuous.

135
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.260
Here's the apical region in a specimen

136
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.053
where almost all the bone has been removed.

137
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.453
Here's the helicotrema.

138
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.590
Here's the hamulus with nerve fibers fanning out from it

139
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.963
to supply the most distal part of the basilar membrane.

140
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.780
The basilar membrane ends here

141
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.623
just short at the end of the cochlear duct which is here.

142
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.300
The modiolus widens to a broad base,

143
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.610
which faces medially into the end

144
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.683
of the internal auditory canal.

145
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.340
The modiolus is the bony conduit

146
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.883
for the nerve fibers going to and from the basilar membrane.

147
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.120
The nerve fibers emerge through the base of the modiolus

148
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.100
into the internal auditory canal,

149
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.853
forming the cochlear nerve.
