00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:90%
But this has not been without its price.

NOTE This is a random note

2
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:27.863 align:middle line:90%
Though we stand at the height of prosperity…

3
00:00:28.314 --> 00:00:31.818 align:middle line:90%
We need only look to the past to remember…

4
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.460 align:middle line:90%
...That Nature is a power that cannot be ignored.

Slide 5
00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Consuming even the mightiest empires…


00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.462 align:middle line:90%
And causing the greatest among us

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.848 align:middle line:90%
... to tremble in her fury.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.423 align:middle line:90%
Yet from adversity the human spirit endures…

Just in case this occurs

00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:18.748 align:middle line:90%
Finding ways to coexist with the Earth…

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:28.552 align:middle line:90%
Or bend it to our cause.

NOTE This is also a version
of a multiline comment.

00:01:33.053 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Pursuing a course beyond distant horizons...

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:42.982 align:middle line:90%
and revealing paths…

00:01:47.213 --> 00:01:49.414 align:middle line:90%
...both towards innovation..

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.611 align:middle line:90%
And unintended catastrophe.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.678 align:middle line:90%
Our survival necessitates new solutions to old problems.

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:21.416 align:middle line:90%
To ensure a future both for ourselves and generations to come…

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:28.315 align:middle line:90%
United in purpose, we must now look beyond borders.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.819 align:middle line:90%
And welcome the dawn of the next era in human civilization.
